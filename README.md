##Setup

Everything should run well in Google Chrome, but you still need to run everything on a local server. To do so, navigate to the `data_arts` directory on your computer and run the following command in the commandline.

`python -m SimpleHTTPServer`

Now, navigate to localhost:8000 in Chrome. You should be able to see a page that says "Welcome to Data Arts".
